  <h3>About Britain Breathing</h3>

  <p>
      Welcome to #BritainBreathing. Hayfever and asthma are increasing and we don't know why. We want you to take part in our experiment to help you and us learn more about when and where allergies occur and why. All you need to do is take a few seconds to log how your allergy is making you feel, and do this as often or as little as you like. Your data will be anonymous and nothing personal will be shared. Use the personal tracker to view your symptoms over time plus access national data to see when and where allergies are occurring via <a href="http://www.britainbreathing.org">www.britainbreathing.org</a>. Thank you for your time!
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have any technical issues with the #BritainBreathing app or like to provide feedback, please contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@britainbreathing.org">admin@britainbreathing.org</a>.

    Please note, we are unable to provide any medical advice. If you are concerned about any allergy symptoms you experience, you should consult with your GP or other suitably qualified healthcare provider in the first instance.
